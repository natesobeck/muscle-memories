  <h4>Here, you can find programs run by real people. You can run them yourselves, rate them, or just get some new ideas.</h4>
  <p id="intro-p">I don't know about you, but I'm tired of instagram-style workouts. There's no progression, the exercises are flashy but unsubstantive, and most importantly: it's not what people actually do in the gym! I wanted to make a place where people can talk about what they actually do, so they can help each other get better. What program are you running? Here's how you get started.</p>
  <div id="step-container">
    <div><em>Step 1:</em> Add the exercises you need to the <a class="step-a" href="/exercises/new">exercises page</a>. We've already got lots of them, so check if they're already there first.</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div><em>Step 2:</em> Add your program overview to the <a class="step-a" href="programs/new">programs page</a>.</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div><em>Step 3:</em> Add the workouts to the program. This is where you're gonna select your exercises.</div>
  </div>
  <p>Or, you can just skip all that and check out the wonderful programs of the other users <a class="step-a" href="/programs">here</a>!</p>
