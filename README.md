## Muscle Memories

Are you as tired of instagram-style workouts as I am? There's no prograssion, the exercises are flashy and ineffective, and most importantly it's not what real people do in the gym! I wanted to make a place where people could come and discuss the programs they actually run. It's a user-friendly and invaluable tool for anyone interested in lifting weights.

The site has a big list of exercises to choose from and users can add more to the website. You construct your workout by selecting some basic details like name and muscle group split. Then you add your workouts to the program and exercises to the workouts. Others can let you know what they think by running your program and leaving a review!

Got some questions about fitness, or just want to talk with some like-minded people? Head into the forum and create a topic about whatever you want. I'd love to hear from you!

### üßä Icebox: 

Since this project is such a passion project, there's a lot more that I'd like to do with it. Heres some planned updates for the futture:

- Add ability to delete exercises only if you created it and it is not currently in any Program.
- Add search functionality for programs, exercises and forum posts.
- Refactor to include muscle groups as a static asset so they may be seleected from a dropdown.
- Create user-friendly easy PDF printouts of the programs so people can run them.
- Create a workout logger where you log the workouts that you've done for easily trackable progress.
- Create a blog portion for sharing my thoughts and ideas on programming and exercise selection.
