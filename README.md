Are you as tired of instagram-style workouts as I am? There's no prograssion, the exercises are flashy and ineffective, and most importantly it's not what real people do in the gym! I wanted to make a place where people could come and discuss the programs they actually run. It's a user-friendly and invaluable tool for anyone interested in lifting weights.

The site has a big list of exercises to choose from and users can add more to the website. You construct your workout by selecting some basic details like name and muscle group split. Then you add your workouts to the program and exercises to the workouts. Others can let you know what they think by running your program and leaving a review!

Got some questions about fitness, or just want to talk with some like-minded people? Head into the forum and create a topic about whatever you want. I'd love to hear from you!
